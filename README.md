Multimodal Route and Cost planner using AI

## Overview

This project builds a unified platform that helps users find the most affordable and reliable way to travel from one location to another. The system compares public transport, walking, and last mile options in a single interface. It focuses on cost transparency and clear step by step guidance. The goal is to reduce travel expenses, simplify planning, and improve confidence in multimodal journeys.

The platform is designed for people moving to a new city, daily commuters, students, and working professionals who want to make better travel decisions.

## Problem

Urban mobility is fragmented. Users must switch between multiple applications to compare buses, metro, and ride options. Public transport appears complex and unreliable. Most people do not know the cheapest route before they travel. This leads to higher commuting costs and increased dependence on expensive transport.

---

## Solution

The system provides a single interface for route discovery and comparison. Users enter a start and end location. The platform generates complete travel plans with cost, time, and transfer details. It ranks routes based on affordability, time, and user preferences.
